\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we first address the importance of the new in-situ analysis workflows. Next, we proposed \texttt{BeeFlow}, an in-situ analysis enabled workflow management system across HPC and cloud platforms with Docker support. We showed how we designed and optimized \texttt{BeeFlow} in the five-layer functionality architecture and evaluated the usability and performance. Moreover, we showcased three commonly used scientific workflows on \texttt{BeeFlow}. Finally, we compared \texttt{BeeFlow} with current existing workflow systems in multiple aspects and show that \texttt{BeeFlow} can be easily adopted to launch modern in-situ workflows in our case studies. Comparisons also showed that \texttt{BeeFlow} brings much better usage complexity and user time cost compared with manual approach and similar results compared to existing commonly used workflow tools. 



%\patg{This just tells what you did you should also state what the comparisons todl you in a concise manner, why use BeeFlow?}
