In this paper, we propose \texttt{BeeFlow} -- an in situ analysis processing workflow management system across multiple platforms using Docker containers. \texttt{BeeFlow} can support both traditional workflows as well as workflows with in situ analysis. \texttt{BeeFlow} leverages Docker containers to provide a portable, flexible, and reproducible workflow management system across HPC and cloud platforms. We showcase how current in situ visualization workflows can apply \texttt{BeeFlow} with DOE production codes VPIC and Flecsale.
