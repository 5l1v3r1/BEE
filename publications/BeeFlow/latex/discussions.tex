\section{Future Work}
In our future work, we plan to exploit more cloud computing platforms to further improve portability. Current BeeFlow uses static scheduling, in which targeting execution platforms are specified by users' configurations files. In our next work, we will try to add dynamic scheduling mechanism, so that user only need to provide available computing resources and BeeFlow will schedule different tasks in workflows to different platform based on multiple factors, e.g. computing intensiveness of each task, computing capability and price of each platforms, data storage locality, etc.
