In this section, we use an example to motivate our work by showing necessity of having automatic scalability test in CI. In \textbf{Fig. \ref{exp}} we show the performance of Legion changes as developers make progresses. However,  it is hard to find out the exactly which commit(s) causes the performance change. For example, the performance of Legion improved significantly from commit \texttt{1e96} to \texttt{4400}. Commit \texttt{4400} is a merge operation between two branches, which totally contains about 61300 lines of code changes composing hundreds of commits. It is hard to tell which commit(s) causes the performance improvement. By searching the commit tree of Legion, we found several commits focusing on bug fixing that may potentially affect performance. We list several of them in \textbf{table \ref{commits}}. So, if scalability test was available in the CI for Legion upgrade, we would be able to easily find the root cause of the performance change by searching in the scalability test results for each commit and keep tracking the changes that benefit or hurt the scalability. 

%\textcolor{red}{In this section, go unfold the example of figure 1. First of all, still focusing on the figure 1, pick up 4400 and 1e96 (it also ok if we also want to pick other pair, but this pair is so catching that we cannot miss), explain the changes in statisics (like LOC of changes, see my email). Adding a table with potential impacts to performance gains coming from the commit tree. We don't need to give any judgement but guess. At the end of this section, also point out how difficult it is for code reviewers and developers to figure out the relationship between change-of-code and performance if scalability test is not included in CI.   }
