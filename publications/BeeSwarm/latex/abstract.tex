Testing is one of the most important steps in software development. It ensures the quality of software. Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely used testing system that can report software quality to the developer in a timely manner during the development progress. Performance, especially scalability, is another key factor for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Though there are many applications and tools to profile the performance of HPC applications, none of them are integrated in the continuous integration. On the other hand, no current continuous integration tools provide easy-to-use scalability test capabilities.
%However, current CI only tests the software's functionality.  No current CI implementation provide . 
In this work, we propose BeeSwarm, a scalability test system that can be easily applied to the current CI test environment enabling scalability test capability for HPC developers. As a showcase, BeeSwarm is integrated into Travis CI and executes the scalability test workflow on Chameleon cloud.
