\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this work, we first discuss the benefit of CI in the software development process. Then, we propose to bring scalability tests to CI so that developers can also get feedback about their applications in terms of scalability in addition to functionality. We design \texttt{BeeSwarm}, as a scalability test system for most CI environments. It is easy to use and can be integrated into any software development workflow. A variety of computing platforms can be used as a computing back-end for scalability tests. Experimental results show that \texttt{BeeSwarm} offers good performance and scalability on large scale tests. %\pat{again what is good? Can we quantify it?}
