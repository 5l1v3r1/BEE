%In the next stage of this work, we will focus on several parts. First, we will continue to optimize the performance of \texttt{BEE-VM} in terms of I/O, network and computational performance. Second, we will continue to improve our \texttt{BEE} framework. We will add more flexible and adaptive scheduling strategies and more sophisticated resource management systems. Third, our current work can only utilize general CPUs, we will extend our \texttt{BEE} framework to utilize accelerators such as GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi, since these are commonly used in HPC application. Finally, we will Integrate system level checkpoint/restoration capability into \texttt{BEE}. It can greatly benefit applications that do not provide native application level checkpoint/restoration capabilities.
