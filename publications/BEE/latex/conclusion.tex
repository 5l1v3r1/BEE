In this work, we first discussed several workflow and productivity problems that current HPC users are facing. Then, we analyzed the potential of integrating commonly used Linux container technology into the existing HPC systems to build a consistent container environment for HPC users. Following this goal, we proposed a container-enabled framework, \texttt{BEE}, and four \texttt{BEE backends} for HPC and cloud systems that allow users to use the compute resources of both HPC systems and cloud computing systems with little extra configuration. Experiments show that \texttt{BEE} can achieve comparable performance. Finally, a case study on a widely used VPIC simulation tool was tested on \texttt{BEE} for performance comparison.
