In this work, we first discussed several workflow and productivity problems that current HPC users are facing. Then, we analyzed the potential of integrating commonly used Docker container technology into the existing HPC systems to build a consistent container environment for HPC users. Following this goal, we proposed several requirements that a successful containerized HPC framework should achieve and we designed a Docker container-enabled HPC framework, \texttt{BEE}, and a universal backend for HPC systems, \texttt{BEE-VM}. \texttt{BEE} satisfies all the requirements we set and also allows users to use the compute resources of both existing HPC systems and cloud computing systems with little extra configuration. Experiments show that \texttt{BEE-VM} can achieve comparable storage I/O performance and computing capability. Finally, a case study on a widely used VPIC simulation tool was tested on BEE and native HPC systems for performance comparison.
