Variations in High Performance Computing (HPC) system software configurations mean that applications are typically configured and built for specific HPC environments. Building applications can require a significant investment of time and effort for application users and requires application users to have additional technical knowledge. Container technologies like Docker bring great benefits to the application development, build and deployment processes. While much cloud computing infrastructure is already designed to support Docker, little work has been done to support production Docker deployment on HPC systems. In this work, we propose a Docker-enabled \textbf{B}uild and \textbf{E}xecution \textbf{E}nvironment (BEE) for HPC systems and detail a standard backend for \texttt{BEE} using virtual machines, the \texttt{BEE-VM}. This brings many of the benefits of Docker to existing HPC machines in user-space without the requirement of specialized pre-installed software and with no system administrator configuration. We show that current HPC application can be easily configured to run within \texttt{BEE}, eliminating the need to reconfigure and rebuild applications for different systems while preserving comparable performance.
