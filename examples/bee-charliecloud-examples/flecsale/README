To run this example on darwin:

BEE must be installed and the path must include BEE_Private/bee-launcher 

This file describes running the example on darwin, a test bed at LANL. 

Open two windows with both on the same front end of darwin:

On window 1:
cd to this directory
salloc -p galton -N2
source setenv_cc_ompi_2.1.2 # loads charliecloud and openmpi
bee_orc_ctl.py 

On Window 2 (in this directory)
ssh to node allocated in Window 1
and cd to this directory

bee_launcher.py -l flecsale_gen

output will be in the output directory where window 1 is pointing

If you want to rerun it without unpacking the tarball (as long as you still have 
    allocation )  use:
bee_launcher.py -r flecsale_gen
Also to see the status:

bee_launcher.py -s
