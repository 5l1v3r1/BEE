This example repeats blast flow. The first output goes in blast_out directory 
with the second into blast_out2 directory. I'm hoping to make this work 
without removing containers. The repeated tasks depend on the first set of tasks
then will reuse the containers without untarring them. Right now it uses two 
separate containers. There is a bug with re-using a container, so this version
just makes sure the example works.

The only way I could get this example to run without an error from blast-output.sh
was if I allocated the nodes with this command
LANG=C salloc -p galton -N5
then ran 
bee_orc_ctl.py

and used on the 2nd screen
ssh <headnode (cn30)> 

The container needs to be fixed. Commenting out the line "SendEnv LANG LC_*" 
may work.
