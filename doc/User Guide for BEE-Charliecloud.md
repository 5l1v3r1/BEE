## Build and Execute Environment (BEE) User Guide for `BEE-Charliecloud`

The following guide shows you how to run `BEE-Charliecloud` on HPC environment.

### Installation
##### Step 1. Install dependecies
If this is your first time using BEE, run `install.sh`.

##### Step 2. Add bee launcher to $PATH
Add the directory of bee-launcher to $PATH, so that it can run anywhere.    

### Launch BEE-Charliecloud task

##### Step 1. Configure task (beefile) file (see examples/bee-charliecloud-examples)
Configure `<task_name>.beefile` file as follow:

* `task_conf`: specifiying configurations related to the task.
   * a. `task_name`: name of task to be executed; should be unique
         and the same as the beefile;

   * b. `exec_target`: `bee-charliecloud`;

   * c. `batch_mode`: `true` or `false`; For details, 
            refer to `User Guide for Batch Mode`.
            NOTE: As of the current release this is unspported by the Charliecloud launcher

   * d. `general_run`: list of scripts that will be run after launching;
     * 1. `script`: name of the script. The script file needs to be in current
            directory.
     * 2. `local_port_fwd`: `[]` indicates no port 
             forwarding used.
     * 3. `remote_port_fwd`: `[]` indicates no port forwarding used.

   * e. `mpi_run`: list of scripts that will be run in parallel by MPI after 
         launching;
     * 1. `script`: name of the script. The script file needs to be in current
            directory.
     * 2. `node_list`: node names i.e. ["cn30", "cn31" ...] to run target job on;
     * 3. `map_by`: (optional)
            map_by flag for mpirun command i.e. "node" or "core", invalid if 
            no map_num
     * 4. `map_num`:  argument to map_by flag.
   * f. `srun_run`: list of scripts that will be run via `srun` across all nodes specified via `exec_env_conf`.
     * 1. `ntasks`: specific the number of tasks to be run, defaults to one per node
   * g. 'delete_after_exec': Upon the completion of the task remove the directory created via 'ch-tar2dir' (default value is false)

* `container_conf`: Charliecloud container info.
  * a. `container_path`: entire path for the Charlicloud tarred image;

* `exec_env_conf`: specifiying all configuration related to the execution 
    environment.
  * a. `bee_charlicloud`: {
     * 1. `node_list`: nodes i.e. ["cn30", "cn31" ...] to be utlized, this list specifies which nodes should be utilized as part of task. Insure that it is utlized to avoid potential conflicts and wasted resources when utlizing BeeFlow.
  }

##### Step 2. Launch task
* a. Prepare run scripts and beefile. See examples/bee-charliecloud-examples.

* b. Open `2` console windows. One serves as `Daemon Control`, another serves 
     as `Client Control`.

* c. On the `Daemon Control` window:
  * 1. Make your allocation.
  * 2. Load charliecloud and openmpi modules. 
         (For flecsale or lammps examples source the env... file.)
  * 3. cd to a directory where you wish to send output.
  * 4. Run `bee_orc_ctl.py` to start the Bee Orchestration daemon. 

* c. On the `Client Control` window:
  * 1. ssh to the same node as on the `Daemon Control` window.
  * 2. cd to the directory containing beefile and scripts. 
  * 3. Run `bee_launcher.py`  to launch Bee job. 
       (i.e. bee_launcher.py -l task (task.beefile defines the job to launch.)
       ** Note: If you get the message "Failed to locate nameserver":
          Make sure:
          1.  You are on the same nodes in both windows.
          2.  That bee_orc_ctl.py is running in the `Daemon Control` window.
 
      Options to launch, control, and monitor tasks.  
     `-l <task_name>`: unpacks Charliecloud image on /var/tmp then 
                       runs task specified by <task_name>.beefile 
                       in the current directory;

     `-s`: list all tasks with status, automatically updates status;

     `-t <task_name>`: terminate task <task_name>;

     `-d <task_name>`: terminate and delete task <task_name> from task list;
